All of the .NET stuff will be in the server folder, however im not sure how to set that up yet. 
We also need to create a basic backend and then hook it up to the SQL server. 

CHECKLIST OF THINGS TO HAVE:

Download .NET 9.0 (dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

Download Node if you dont have it already 
- Node will be used for installing npm packages for our frontend which is basically libraries/add-ons
