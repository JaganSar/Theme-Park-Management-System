All of the .NET stuff will be in this backend folder, however
im not sure how to set that up yet and I am a bit limited right now
since im in galveston. I will look specifically for a .NET + React 
setup once I am back home. 


CHECKLIST OF THINGS TO HAVE:

Download .NET 9.0 (dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

Download Node if you dont have it already (Not sure which version since we will be using docker probably to have the code run the same in all cases)
- Node will be used for installing npm packages for our frontend which is basically libraries/add-ons
